; FIX 1: Changed BROKER_HOST '127.0.0.1' to '10.98.15.104' to match the actual IP address of the RabbitMQ server in the ZeroTier network.
    ; NOTE: should be Tim's IP address (ZT IP) or whoever is hosting the RabbitMQ server.
    ; NOTE: will only work if the RabbitMQ server has the exact sames names (test, testHost, testExchange, testQueue, etc).
BROKER_HOST = 10.98.15.104
BROKER_PORT = 5672
USER = test
PASSWORD = test
VHOST = testHost
EXCHANGE = testExchange
QUEUE = testQueue
;EXCHANGE_TYPE = ???
AUTO_DELETE = true
